# SHORT(ish) Details of my LONG COVID Fatigue Recovery

&nbsp;

## Intro

This is approximately the routine I followed to recover from Long Covid. It's rough - apologies for typos. The exercises were taken from [the nuffield guide](/covid-rehab-journal.pdf)

I take no responsibility for this work or derivations of it. You have to do what's best for you and only you know that :blush:!


&nbsp;

## Aim

The aim was to get a basic life back.

I had been near bed bound and severely fatigued for a few weeks. Using this plan, it took me 4 weeks to be moving well and 8 weeks to have good energy (full dog walk and still do stuff after), but everyones body is different - most importantly -> don't worry about trying to find a timeline for recovery.


The keys to this plan are:

1. Mental Health / Good Sleep
2. Sitting
3. Walking
4. Strength Building


## 1.Mental Health / Good Sleep

&nbsp;

### Overview

People banging on about mental health can be annoying - Long Covid is NOT in the mind!

However, I do feel that until I got my head sorted, I wasn't allowing my body the energy it needed to heal.

&nbsp;

### Phone / News

I cut out negativity (such as news) from my life. The only news was that I was poorly and needed to recover. I asked my wife to let me know if anything really major came up. Otherwise, I opted for a bubble.

I was in bed, but on my phone 4 hours a DAY! So, I cut out all phone usage except for meditation apps. I saw an ad about how engaging audiobooks are - so I cut those out too in order to save energy. That's energy I could put towards getting better.

&nbsp;

### Be Wary of Long Covid Forums

Firstly, I'm NOT talking here about the MOST EXCELLENT sites like Nuffield https://www.nuffieldhealth.com/covid-rehab .

I'm talking about the Facebook etc forums that exist for 'Long Covid Communities'.

These *should* be places you can get help. 

But, in true internet style, they are usually where the desperate go to shout about their woes.

Remember - when people get better, they stop going to these forums!

If there's a miracle cure - it'll be front page of the news.

&nbsp;

### Return to Work

Not working was very stressful for me. In fact, I'd say it was more stressful than COVID! Having recently moved house, we didn't have much money to fall back on.

My workplace had a lean contract, so I wasn't entitled to sick pay. We worked out a way to get by for a few months, then I tried hard to cut it out of my mind. We'd cross any future bridge when needed. This was hard, but clearing my mind was critical to recovery.

When I did return to work, I started using a computer without going to work. Then I started 2h a day. I built up, but using my own time to extend the day more, so I knew when it would be safe to increase my work hours.

&nbsp;

### Water and Good Food

I drank a lot of water. No tea or alcohol.

> If your pee is clear, you've nothing to fear. Yellow or brown, you're going down.

&nbsp;

### Time

One of the hardest things for me was time. With a broken leg, you know to give it a few weeks. An open timeline can be more daunting. 

Trying to get 'better by x date' was a mindset I had to get rid of in order to get better. 

&nbsp;

### Mindfulness and Meditation

Being in the 'Now' feels like the last place you want to be, but mindfulness and meditation really worked. It took a few weeks to feel the benefits.

 'Practicing The Power of Now' (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Practising-Power-Now-Meditations-Exercises/dp/0340822538)

&nbsp;

### Hypnosis

I found it really hard to be mindful when I was so stressed and in pain, but hypnosis really hit home and helps kick off better habits.

I highly recommend all of Paul McKenna books on Anxiety, Stress and Sleep. 

- I can make you sleep (Paul McKenna)
- Freedom from anxiety (Paul McKenna)

There are excellent Free Hypnosis Recodings:
Anxiety - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=invPy-f_DPA

Full List - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQA9Yp7gjf0&list=PLHZnhN3fKuAY6CsC7i79Uv6OHf0iA8L7f


&nbsp;

### Sleep

Getting a good nights sleep was hard. Again, Paul McKennas book on sleep was excellent. 

There's a free hypnosis here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LA5UlfYrII&list=PLHZnhN3fKuAY6CsC7i79Uv6OHf0iA8L7f&index=2

Actions:

- No screens 1 hour before going to bed.
- Changed our very uncomfortable mattress.
- Doing the sleep hypnosis if I was struggling with sleep.

&nbsp;

### Make Life Easier For Yourself

If there were times I had energy, I used it to do the things that were hard at other times. 

For me, a key thing was getting my clothes out for the next day. I would put them on top of my drawers, so all I had to do was step into stuff in the morning and not waste energy finding stuff.

We made massive soups or risotto's so we could have healthy reheats. It saves worrying about the next meal all the time.


&nbsp;

## 2. Sitting

Sitting was a key part to getting a difference between day and night. I had to practice sitting as it was very tiring to start. Here's what I did.

1. Sit on a chair or sofa, with my feet on the ground (that's important!)
2. Watch something relaxing or funny if you can - no gritty dramas!
3. Pay attention to my legs. Notice when they were tensing or shaking.
4. Gently, and with kindness to myself, try to relax them. I did deep belly breathing and imagined the breath going all the way into the legs, giving them nourishment.
5. Repeat as needed.
6. When tired, go back to bed.

It took a few days to see the benefit, but eventually got easier.

I also massaged my legs at times or had a bath to help ease the discomfort.

&nbsp;

## 3. Walking

I really wanted to walk freely again. I wanted to get to the shops and walk the dog. But my attempts were causing a serious pattern of 'boom and bust'. I would do nothing all day, then go out for a 700 step walk. It would ruin me and I'd be back to square 1 the next day. 

I devised a plan to increase walking, while avoiding boom and bust. It requires a steps tracker. Full details [here](/README.md). It was instrumental in my recovery.

Basically:

1. Gauge comfortable baseline number of steps (1-2 days)
2. Use [the tables here](ReadMe.md#how-to-use-the-steps-table) as **a guide to spread activity through the day**. Try to keep in range. If you've hit the steps too early, be sure to rest! Don't worry too much if  under, but try to get near :relaxed: . 

3. Build up the number of steps carefully, keeping in line with the steps/time guide.

&nbsp;

### Lymphatic Drainage.

Lymphatic Drainage has been proven (in a small study) to reduce fatigue https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9010124/ . Videos on the Perrin Technique were poor at the time of writing, but there was an excellent video here on a similar technique - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4yvyWkFQiA

I went through the video a few times, then made this list:

1. Belly breaths + Press
2. Armpits
3. Collar bone and chest
4. Neck + Base of Neck
5. 'Spok' cirles and drag down from ear.
6. Neck + Work down to collar bone
7. Jaw 7's
8. Back of neck to front shoulder
9. Nose to ear then down
10. Forehead to ear
11. 'Spok circles'
12. Back of neck to front chest
13. Collar bones + Chest
14. Belly Breaths

&nbsp;

## The Weekly Recovery Plan

The typical day examples are split into 3 - 'Bed Rest to Sitting', 'Getting Moving' and 'Improving Progress (more mobile)'.

&nbsp;

## Typical Day - Bed Rest -> Sitting

- For exercises, see [## Exercises - Starting Out](#exercises---starting-out)


I used a fitness tracker and we worked out how many steps things took for pacing.

| Time      | Activity |
| --------- | ----------- |
| 7am       | Got up. Setting a wake time is important for ensuring you sleep at night. DIDNT brush teeth. When I did brush, I sat down to save my legs doing work for now.      |
|        | Drank water ASAP and had a sugary snack. I found sugars asap really helped.      |
|           | Got breakfast. I also took a vitamin pill (with Iron).
|  7:30am         | Tried to sit upright for a little. Went to bed when tired.  |
|    | Listened to '[relaxing classical music](https://open.spotify.com/user/sonymusicuk/playlist/1ZJpJahEFst7u8njXeGFyv?si=wb1dsTHtRR25odSl5ukDbw)', meditated and slept. If possible, try more sitting practice      |
|  10am  | Drank water and Snack     |
|    | Repeated sitting practice/ bed rest / meditation / 'relaxing classical music'     |
|  12pm  | Drank water and had a proper meal.    |
|    | Repeated sitting practice/ bed rest / meditation / 'relaxing classical music'      |
|  3pm  | Drank water and Snack     |
|    | Repeated sitting practice/ bed rest / meditation / 'relaxing classical music'     |
|  5pm  | Drank water and have a proper meal.    |
|    | Repeat sitting practice/ bed rest / meditation / 'relaxing classical music'      |
|  7:30pm | Drank water and had an easily digestible snack (e.g. grapes)     |
|  9pm  | Made a note of steps for the day..    
|    | Got my clothes out for the next day and put them where I could easily get to them (e.g. On top of your drawers). Had drinks/ food to hand. Go to bed.    |
|       |  I found this [free sleep hypnosis on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LA5UlfYrII) very good.  |
|       |   If I couldn't sleep, did meditations, such as Yoga Nidra. After some practice, my fitbit recorded that as 'light sleep' and it helped keep the mind at ease. It took me about 2 weeks to get into meditation. |
|  All Day | Gentle stretches, this helped get the muscles ready for stage 4.   |
|  | Avoided the news. Asked someone to inform me of anything critical   |
|  | If watching/ listening to TV, made it light comedy like Friends, Frasier, Modern Family. Nothing gritty.  |
|  | If I felt up to it, did a timed (20/30 second) 'mini-walk' around the house. Rested after  |
|  | If you felt up to it, tried one or two of the exercises below. Rest after. |



&nbsp;

## Typical Day - Getting Moving

This was my schedule for 4-5 weeks.

- For exercises, start with [## Exercises - Starting Out](#exercises---starting-out), then after a few weeks moved to  [## Exercises - Medium ](#exercises---medium). Build up carefuly. Avoid boom and busts!!!

| Time      | Activity |
| --------- | ----------- |
| 6-7am       | Got up. Setting a wake time is important for ensuring you sleep at night. It's better to get up and go back to bed later if you need.      |
|        | Drank water ASAP. Had a snack too (needed the sugar).      |
|           | Got breakfast. Took a vitamin pill (with Iron). Brushed teeth later and sat down when brushing them.
|  7:30am         | **Start the Exercises (see below for exercises)**. Only did one or two to start. The key was to try. Very careful in week one as capabilities not known.  |
|           | I also found this [Lymphatic Drainage Massage Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4yvyWkFQiA) helpful.  |
|    | Tried to stay sat up after, even if just watching TV or reading.      |
|       | Tai Chi     |
| 9am       | Tried walking a little, but keeping an eye on the steps. On target? Over? If you over, went for a rest/ sit down. Maybe watch a movie?      |
|  10am  | Water and Snack. Check number of steps. Around target?     |
|    | Stay sat up, but took a timed bed rest even if feeling well. I would do 3 '[relaxing classical](https://open.spotify.com/user/sonymusicuk/playlist/1ZJpJahEFst7u8njXeGFyv?si=wb1dsTHtRR25odSl5ukDbw))' songs or a meditation laying down.    |
|  12pm  | Drink water and have a proper meal.    |
|    | Tried the exercises again (don't expect too much).     |
|    | Tried to stay sat up after. Took a timed bed rest/ meditation/ relaxing classical songs if needed.     |
|  3pm  | Water and Snack. Check steps.     |
|    | Rest - careful now. Too much rest from this point could lead to a poor nights sleep. Started doing 'Arrow Words' and puzzles to keep my mind active. Paper magazines to keep me off my phone.    |
|   | Check number of steps.    |
|  5pm  | Drank water and have a proper meal.    |
|    | Repeated sitting practice, resting if needed     |
|  7:30pm | Water and have an easily digestible snack (e.g. grapes)     |
|   | Settled down with **relaxing** TV, then time without screen in preparation for sleep.    |
|  9pm  | Got clothes out for the next day and put them where I could easily get to them (e.g. On top of the drawers). Had drinks/ food to hand. Go to bed.    |
|       |   I found this [free hypnosis for sleep on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LA5UlfYrII) very good.  |
|  All Day | Do gentle stretches, especially for the calves, Quads and Hamstrings.   |
|   | Go for walks (even if just around the house). Be sure to keep in line with expected steps for the day.   |
|   | Ideally, try to get 2 reps of all exercises in. This wasn't possible to start (I only managed 3 exercises on my first day), but things improved.   |
|  | Avoid the news. Asked someone to inform me of anything critical.   |
|    | Every hour or two, go to bed for a lay down rest (even if you feel well). Listened to classical music, meditate, or just rest for 15 minutes. I set 3 '[relaxing classical](https://open.spotify.com/user/sonymusicuk/playlist/1ZJpJahEFst7u8njXeGFyv?si=wb1dsTHtRR25odSl5ukDbw)' songs as my aim. No phone faffing!    |
|  | If watching/ listening to TV, made it light comedy like Friends, Frasier, Modern Family. Nothing gritty.  |
|  | Started taking longer walks in line with the steps guide. Rest after.  |
|  | **Avoid Phone Faffing! Used 'screen time' stats or an app such as AntiSocial to be honest with about whether you are wasting valuable rest time on phone**  |


&nbsp;

## Typical Day - Improving Progress (Getting more mobile)

Getting to the point of having more freedom, trying to increase the difficulty of the exercises. Kept doing them as early in the day as possible. 

- Built up the exercise difficulty (carefully!) - [## Exercises - Medium ](#exercises---medium) or [## Exercises - More Taxing](#exercises---more-taxing).

- Kept a close eye on steps

- Fewer rest times (but still took rests!). Tried not to snooze after 4pm to help ensure a good nights sleep. Did rest though!

My schedule was something like this:


| Time      | Activity |
| --------- | ----------- |
| 6-7am       | Got up. Setting a wake time was important for ensuring you sleep at night. Better to get up and go back to bed later if needed.      |
|        | Drank water ASAP. Snack too.      |
|           | Breakfast. I also took a vitamin pill (with Iron). Brushed teeth later. Sat down when brushing them.
|  7:30am         | **Start the Exercises (list of exercises below)**. It doesn't matter if you only do one or two. They key is to try. Be very careful in week one. You don't know your limit yet.  |
|           | I also found this [Lymphatic Drainage Massage Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4yvyWkFQiA) helpful.  |
|    | Rest and walk - Try to keep on your feet more, even if watching TV      |
| 9am       | Tai Chi     |
|  10am  | Drank water and Snack. Check number of steps. Around target?     |
|    | Stay sat up, but take a timed bed rest even if feeling well. I would do 3 '[relaxing classical](https://open.spotify.com/user/sonymusicuk/playlist/1ZJpJahEFst7u8njXeGFyv?si=wb1dsTHtRR25odSl5ukDbw))' songs or a meditation laying down.    |
|    | Rest and walk - Try to keep on feet more, even if watching TV      |
|  12pm  | Drink water and have a proper meal.    |
|    | Try the exercises again (don't expect too much).    |
|    | Try to stay sat up after. Took timed bed rest/ meditation/ relaxing classical songs if needed.     |
|    | Rest and walk - Try to keep on feet more, even if watching TV      |
|  3pm  | Drank water and Snack. Check  steps.     |
|    | Rest - though be careful now. Too much rest from this point could lead to a poor nights sleep. Started doing 'Arrow Words' and puzzles to keep my mind active but my body still. Paper magazines to keep me off my phone.    |
|   | Check number of steps.    |
|  5pm  | Drank water and have a proper meal.    |
|    | Rest and walk - Try to keep on feet more, even if watching TV. Start settling down for the evening.      |
|  7:30pm | Drank water and have an easily digestible snack (e.g. grapes)     |
|   | Settle down with **relaxing** TV in preparation for sleep.    |
|  8pm | Read or do arrowwords - no screens    |
|  9pm  | Get clothes out for the next day and put them where I could easily get to them (e.g. On top of your drawers). Have drinks/ food to hand. Go to bed.    |
|       |   I found this [free hypnosis for sleep on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LA5UlfYrII) very good.  |

|  | Avoid the news. Asked someone to inform me of anything critical.   |
|  | If watching/ listening to TV, made it light comedy like Friends, Frasier, Modern Family or something factual (but not gloomy!). Nothing gritty.  |
|  | Made the steps guide rather the main point of focus for activity. Tried to be more 'generally active' to keep the muscles working. It was really nice to get out and about, even in bad weather. |

## Excercises - Tai Chi.

I am LOVING Tai Chi. From my 3rd week of the recovery plan I started very (VERY!) light Tai chi. It's all about working the body and getting a good flow of energy through your body.

It looks and feels a bit silly to start - but it works!

Dr Paul Lam has this free intro on YouTube. It's only part of his DVD, but it's great to see if you might take to it. - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIOHGrYCEJ4

This is also part of a DVD, but has enough to get started with - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIZVuFr9SAM

The resource I've been loving most is The 'Essentials of Tai Chi and Qigong', by David Dorian Ross on Amazon Primes 'The Great Courses'. It's £5.49/month, but well worth it for me https://www.amazon.co.uk/Essentials-Tai-Chi-Qigong/dp/B07JQJRJS4/ref=atv_pr_sw_sc.
